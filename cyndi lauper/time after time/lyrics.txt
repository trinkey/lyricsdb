Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me
I can't hear what you've said

Then you say, "go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay

Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, "go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
