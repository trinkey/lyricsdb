Giddy-up, giddy-up
(Giddy-up)
Giddy-up, giddy-up

Wanna move into the fool's gold room
With my pulse on the animal jewels
Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose
With the luminous moves
Bored of these limits
Let me get it, let me get it like

Wow!
It's like right now
It's like wow!
It's like right, right now
It's like wow!
It's like right now
It's like wow!
It's like right now
Oh wow!

It's my life, your life
Live it once, can't live it twice
So nice, so nice
Smooth like a tidal wave, take you on a getaway
My friends, your friends
Livin' every day like it's just about to end
Now they're pissin' in the wind cause it's so pine fresh
Right now
Yeah I, I wanna get it like

Wow!
It's like right now
It's like wow!
It's like
Giddy-up!
Wow!
It's like right now
Wow!
Oh wow
Oh wow, it's like right now

It's your life
Falling like a hot knife
Call your wife, secular times, these times
My demon's on the cell phone
To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong
It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes "boom"
Standing on a line doin' jiu-jitsu
Girl in a bikini with the Lamborghini, shih tzu

It's your life
You gotta try to get it right
Look around, don't forget where you came from
It's just another perfect night
We're gonna take it around the world (like wow)
We're gonna take it around the world (like wow)
When this one is over (like wow)
I lose my emotions (take around the world)
We're gonna take it around the world (like wow)

Like
Wow, wow!
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Like
Giddy-up
Wow, what a beautiful day!
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
